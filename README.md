With its simple and intuitive design, even the most mathematically challenged can perform basic arithmetic calculations with ease. So what are you waiting for? Go forth and conquer the world with the power of Formula-inator! Mwahahaha! Just wait until Perry the Platypus hears about this! Bwahahaha!

## Features

- **Perform Basic Arithmetic Operations:** The Formula-inator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input numbers and select the desired arithmetic operation through intuitive buttons on the interface. The calculator performs the calculations in real-time and displays the result instantly.

- **Clear Input and Reset:** The app allows users to clear the input and reset the calculator with a single click. The "AC" (All Clear) button wipes the current input and resets the calculator, providing a fresh start for new calculations.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Formula-inator is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture and allows for efficient rendering and state management.

- **SCSS:** The Formula-inator's styling and layout are implemented using SCSS (Sass), a powerful CSS preprocessor. SCSS enhances CSS by providing features like variables, nesting, mixins, and more, which make styling and maintaining the calculator's stylesheets more efficient and maintainable.

- **React Icons:** The React Icons library is employed to include icons in the application, such as the sun and moon icons used for the light and dark mode toggle button.

- **Classnames:** The Classnames library is utilized to apply conditional CSS class names to the calculator components. This allows for dynamic styling based on the current theme (light or dark mode).
